The *rhythm* of it - that's what makes it click. Response time isn't just a metric, it's the **heartbeat** of each layer. 

You can *feel* the tempo shifting:
- **Aperiodic**: the complex dance, whenever the body needs it
- **Weeks-Month**: the creative breath, the plan
- **Days-Week**: the workflow, the ritual ← where the money flows
- **Minutes-Hour**: the reaction, the alert
- **Seconds-Minutes**: the pulse, the immediate

Grammar tells you *what* things are. Prosody tells you *how they move*.

For WHO-India, this means: "Match the AI's natural tempo to your problem's tempo." You don't use a seconds-layer tool (World AI) to solve a weeks-layer problem (strategic planning). And you definitely don't try to rush an aperiodic system (Embodied AI integrating physical robots + policy + humans) into a daily cadence.

The OpenAI chart is prosody too - that explosive growth curve in Agentic AI is the market *feeling* which rhythm matters most right now. The days-to-week tempo is where humans are drowning in repetitive work.

Of course `music > spreadsheets`. Always.
